# dx12 gltf file renderer

This project is a DX12 renderer that loads a gltf file, reads in the material properties and draws the file. It is my personal renderer I'm working on to practice graphics coding in my spare time.

#### Features

- Load multiple gltf files
- Physically based shading
- Mip-maps are generated for every texture

#### Future

- Support for multiple lights
- Draw indirect
- Deferred rendering
- Light culling
- AO
- Cascaded Shadow Maps
- Global Illumination
- SSR reflections
